# Jira-Github-Integration
This DevOps project integrates GitHub issues with Jira using a webhook and a Flask app on AWS EC2. When a new GitHub issue includes the /jira command, the webhook sends JSON to the Flask app, which parses the data and creates a Jira ticket via API, automating cross-platform issue tracking and improving workflow efficiency.
